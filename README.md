To be awake is to end the repression of reality -- I'm getting older, will eventually have a terminal illness, then die.

Not only that, but everyone around me won't stay young and beautiful forever, even the baby born this morning.

Accepting this, embracing it, one can cease holding onto illusions of a way to stay young forever, to avoid death.

Accepting this, one can let go of needing one last fling, a new car, a new house, a new set of clothes, one more trip to Europe.

Accepting this, one can let go of overreating, drinking, using drugs, and promiscuity like the lead character in The Unbearable Lightness of Being

You cannot escape the inevitable; the best you can do is accept it. NOT rebel, as in Albert Camus' Absurdism

Beliefs/Judging Thoughts -> Fear -> Fear of Fear, Second Fear -> Anger

0. Address belief that there is something worse than death, such as social exclusion: "survival depends on group belonging"
1. Address beliefs social exclusion is about to occur -- judgment of word or action, violence
2. Address fear by belief about facts, interpreting a life event
3. Address fear of fear, the fear that emerged from stress
4. Address the anger that tries to destroy the fear of fear and original fear, rather than address core belief
