here, be patient with everyone and everything else, such as people and
circumstances

    When parents suffer from wanting what they do not have and being unable to
    face these desires in prayer, surrendering to God's will for them not to
    have them, they end up abusing and neglecting their children, as well as
    modelling a pilgrimage to Hell -- even when they call it Heaven.

    Problem-solving is also crucial. Not merely surrender to God's will today,
    but finding a way to solve the problem by designing a solution and
    implementing it.
